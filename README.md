##A simple MEAN.JS Donation app

This app is a crude port of a WordPress/AngularJS Donation App I created for a charity I work with. The full live	app can be found here [Donate App](http://muntadaaid.org/donate). As this app is mainly practice to keep my skills sharp, it currently lacks most of the features found in the live version. I truly love the MEAN stack and in particular AngularJS.

This application tracks users and projects.
			
1. View projects or signup to get started.
2. Add new projects.
3. Have fun...
				
### Quick notes regarding the WordPress back-ended version

The WordPress/AngularJS version was originally connected using WP-API however due to the slow server the site is hosted on I decided to disconnect it from the API end point and instead fed the data directly into the page.  

This version is currently missing these features
	
* Search
* Routed categories
* Tabbed progress navigation
* Multiple donations
* Individual packages per project
* Better communication (selected items highlighted, better errors)
* Order details page
* Confirmation page
* Add/Change project image
* Auto redirect categories with single project

Although I have the greatest of intentions to have both versions reach parity, I'll doubtfully have the time. If anyone wants help on how I implemented the above features, let me know and I'll try getting it added. I of course encourage anyone else to continue and help out :-)
